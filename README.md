### Art Piece 1
![Drake-Brockman art](images/drake.jpg?raw=true "Drake-Brockman art")
Geoffrey Drake-Brockman is a cybernetics artist who specializes in large-scale public installations. Geoffrey creates an environment of interaction and mutual feedback between humans and machines. He also enjoys using mirrors and bright colors in his work! He uses sensors to detect people when they come closer and highlights the emotions of humans to interact with sculptures. The way he goes about designing his installations is he sets up the preconditions, but does not regulate when actions will occur. He aims to create self-determined and expressive machines! His artwork really caught my attention because of how unregulated it truly is and how he designs his machines to react by seeemingly thinking for themselves.
